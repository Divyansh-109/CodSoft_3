Learning new skills by building these amazing projects as part of my internship at CodSoft.

A Password Generator Program , which is a very useful tool that generates random strong passwords of desired length for users, It allows users to specify length and complexity of the prassword randomly generated.

This helped me to learn about Python and also used random and string, in-built modules of python to make it more functional and work perfectly.
